\subsection{Task: Comparing recursive bisection to direct $k$-way partitioning [10 points]}

Use the incomplete \texttt{Bench\_metis.m} for your implementation. Compare the cut obtained from Metis 5.0.2 after applying recursive bisection and direct multiway partitioning for the graphs in question. Consult the Metis manual, and type \texttt{help metismex} in your MATLAB command line to familiarize yourself with the way the Metis recursive and direct multiway partitioning functionalities should be invoked. Summarize your results in Table~\ref{table:Compare_Metis} for 16 and 32 partitions. Comment on your results. Was this behavior anticipated? Visualize the partitioning results for both graphs for 32 partitions.
